Transmission may also occur when these materials are directly introduced into broken skin, the nose, the eyes, or the mouth, or presumably, via the bite of an infected rodent. Person-to-person transmission has not been reported, with the exception of vertical transmission from infected mother to fetus, and rarely, through organ transplantation.',\n",
       "  'LCMV is most commonly recognized as causing neurological disease, as its name implies, though infection without symptoms or mild febrile illnesses are more common clinical manifestations. \\n                \\nFor infected persons who do become ill, onset of symptoms usually occurs 8-13 days after exposure to the virus as part of a biphasic febrile illness. This initial phase, which may last as long as a week, typically begins with any or all of the following symptoms: fever, malaise, lack of appetite, muscle aches, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms appearing less frequently include sore throat, cough, joint pain, chest pain, testicular pain, and parotid (salivary gland) pain. \\n                \\nFollowing a few days of recovery, a second phase of illness may occur. Symptoms may consist of meningitis (fever, headache, stiff neck, etc.), encephalitis (drowsiness, confusion, sensory disturbances, and/or motor abnormalities, such as paralysis), or meningoencephalitis (inflammation of both the brain and meninges). LCMV has also been known to cause acute hydrocephalus (increased fluid on the brain), which often requires surgical shunting to relieve increased intracranial pressure. In rare instances, infection results in myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord) and presents with symptoms such as muscle weakness, paralysis, or changes in body sensation. An association between LCMV infection and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscles) has been suggested. \\n                \\nPrevious observations show that most patients who develop aseptic meningitis or encephalitis due to LCMV survive. No chronic infection has been described in humans, and after the acute phase of illness, the virus is cleared from the body. However, as in all infections of the central nervous system, particularly encephalitis, temporary or permanent neurological damage is possible. Nerve deafness and arthritis have been reported. \\n                \\nWomen who become infected with LCMV during pregnancy may pass the infection on to the fetus. Infections occurring during the first trimester may result in fetal death and pregnancy termination, while in the second and third trimesters, birth defects can develop. Infants infected In utero can have many serious and permanent birth defects, including vision problems, mental retardation, and hydrocephaly (water on the brain). Pregnant women may recall a flu-like illness during pregnancy, or may not recall any illness. \\n                \\nLCM is usually not fatal. In general, mortality is less than 1%.',\n",
       "  'Individuals of all ages who come into contact with urine, feces, saliva, or blood of wild mice are potentially at risk for infection. Owners of pet mice or hamsters may be at risk for infection if these animals originate from colonies that were contaminated with LCMV, or if their animals are infected from other wild mice. Human fetuses are at risk of acquiring infection vertically from an infected mother. \\n                \\nLaboratory workers who work with the virus or handle infected animals are also at risk. However, this risk can be minimized by utilizing animals from sources that regularly test for the virus, wearing proper protective laboratory gear, and following appropriate safety precautions.']}"

She has burning upon urination, which started 1 day ago and worsened despite increasing water intake and taking cranberry extract. Her vital signs and physical exam are within normal ranges, with the absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. The task is to determine the best treatment for this patient.\\nLet's break down the options:\\nA. Ampicillin: Ampicillin is an antibiotic that can be used to treat UTIs. However, it is not typically the first choice for treating UTIs in pregnant women due to the availability of safer options.\\nB. Ceftriaxone: Ceftriaxone is another antibiotic that can be used to treat UTIs. Like Ampicillin, it is not usually the first choice for treating UTIs in pregnant women due to the availability of safer alternatives.\\nC. Doxycycline: Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. However, it is contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of teratogenicity and adverse effects on fetal bone and teeth development. Therefore, it is not a suitable choice for this patient.\\nD. Nitrofurantoin: Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic that is considered safe and effective for the treatment of UTIs during pregnancy, particularly after the first trimester. It is the preferred first-line treatment for UTIs in pregnant women due to its safety profile.\\nGiven the patient's pregnancy and the safety profile of the available treatment options, the best treatment for this patient is Nitrofurantoin. This choice is supported by the patient's presentation, the absence of contraindications, and the safety and effectiveness of Nitrofurantoin in treating UTIs in pregnant women.\\nAnswer: D.\",\n",
       "  \"The question presents a tragic case of a 3-month-old baby who died suddenly at night while asleep. No cause of death was determined based on the autopsy. The task is to determine which precaution could have prevented the death of the baby.\\nLet's break down the options:\\nOption A: Placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping. This is a major recommendation to prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a condition where infants unexpectedly die in their sleep with no cause found on autopsy. Placing infants in a supine position (on their backs) to sleep on a firm mattress reduces the risk of suffocation and aids in maintaining an open airway during sleep.\\nOption B: Keeping the infant covered and maintaining a high room temperature. This is not an evidence-based method for reducing the risk of SIDS. In fact, high room temperatures may actually increase the risk of SIDS.\\nOption C: Application of a device to maintain the sleeping position. The use of positional devices is not recommended due to potential risks, and is not an evidence-based method for reducing the risk of SIDS.\\nOption D: Avoiding pacifier use during sleep. Pacifier use during sleep has been associated with a reduced risk of SIDS, thus avoiding it would not be a preventative measure.\\nGiven the sudden and unexplained death of the baby, the best precaution to potentially prevent such an unfortunate event is to place the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping. This choice is supported by the presentation and the evidence-based recommendations for reducing the risk of SIDS. Therefore, the correct answer is  A. Placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping.\\nAnswer: A.\",\n",
       "  \"The question presents a case of a 3-week-old infant who is being seen by the pediatrician due to concerns about his feeding habits. The infant was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, the infant has been fussy, regurgitating all of his feeds, and the vomit is yellow in color. On physical examination, the child's abdomen is minimally distended, but no other abnormalities are found. The infant's symptoms, including fussiness, regurgitation of all feeds, and yellow vomit, suggest a problem with the digestive system. The fact that the vomit is yellow indicates that it contains bile, which is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile is normally released into the small intestine to aid in digestion. However, in this case, it is being regurgitated, which suggests that there may be an obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract.\\nThe possible embryologic errors that could account for this presentation are:\\nA. Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud: During embryonic development, the pancreas forms from two buds that arise from the foregut. The ventral bud migrates to fuse with the dorsal bud, forming the pancreas. If the ventral bud does not migrate properly, it can result in pancreatic tissue being located outside of the pancreas, which can cause obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract.\\nB. Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize: During embryonic development, the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is initially solid, but it later becomes hollow through a process called recanalization. If the proximal duodenum fails to recanalize completely, it can result in an obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract.\\nC. Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus: The pylorus is the muscular valve that connects the stomach to the small intestine. If the pylorus becomes abnormally thickened, it can cause an obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract.\\nD. Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline: During embryonic development, the lateral body folds move ventrally and fuse in the midline to form the anterior abdominal wall. If this process fails, it can result in an omphalocele, a congenital defect in which the intestines or other abdominal organs protrude through the navel.\\nBased on the information provided, the most likely embryologic error that could account for this presentation is abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus (option C). This is because the infant's symptoms suggest an obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract, and abnormal thickening of the pylorus can cause such an obstruction.\\nAnswer: C.\"]}"
